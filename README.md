# Interactive Birds Platform

Developed for the Hypermedia Development subject in UVic

## The platform

This was a multimeda project developed by Guillem Rib√≥ in 2020. The main page of this web is a __map of Catalonia__, where you can __choose a region__ to see the most __common birds__ that live there. In the detail page of the region, you can choose between 3 birds, see a video of them, read some basic information, and listen to its sound. 

## The Game

Once you have visited all the regions, you can play a game where you can demonstrate if you know all the birds shown in the map. First you need to listen to the sound, and then choose which bird you think it's about.
